# C-MINI-PROJECT
Time conversion in C ⏱️
📌 Description

This program converts a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.
It takes total seconds as input from the user and displays the time in HH:MM:SS format.

This is a beginner-friendly C program that demonstrates:

Input using scanf()

Arithmetic operations

Use of division (/) and modulus (%)

Proper output formatting using printf()

🛠️ How the Program Works

The user enters the total number of seconds.

The program calculates:

Hours by dividing total seconds by 3600

Remaining seconds using modulus %

Minutes by dividing remaining seconds by 60

Seconds using modulus % 60

The final output is displayed in HH:MM:SS format with leading zeros.

▶️ How to Compile and Run

Open terminal or command prompt

Compile the program:

gcc Time_convrsion.c -o Time_conversion


Run the program:

./Time_conversion
